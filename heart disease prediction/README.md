## Features:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type (cp)
- Resting blood pressure (trestbps)
- Cholesterol levels (chol)
- Fasting blood sugar (fbs)
- Electrocardiographic results (restecg)
- Maximum heart rate achieved (thalach)
- Exercise induced angina (exang)
- Old peak
- Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (ca)
- Thalassemia (thal)

## Installation
Install necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
